# Features

## Manage your daily tasks

By using the student oriented task form, your tasks can now be sorted in a meaningful manner.

### Drag & Drop

The tasks can also be dragged from one list to another to help the user visually organise their tasks.

### Edit tasks

In the event of a mistake or change in plans, tasks can also be modified, marked as completed or event deleted by opening up the task editor (three dots when hovering over a task).

## Breakdown your time

By using the timer, users can cycle through different work cycles including studying (25min), small break (5min) & longer break (15min). 

This time seperation technique is called Pomodoro & it's goal is to optimise focus & productivity when studying by integrating multiple small breaks in your study sessions.

# Project architecture
This project uses the popular MERN stack group of technologies. This includes MongoDB for the persistance layer, Node.js using the Express.js framework for the backend application & React.js for the frontend application (rendered and updated on the client's machine).

As you can see, this architecure is following the Model-Vue-Control(MVC) structure commonly seen in many fullstack applications.
