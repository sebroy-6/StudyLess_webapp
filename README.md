# Introduction

## Personal study assistant - Website

The goal of this project is to create a website that help students simplify and optimise their studying schedule. This project is ongoing and will receive new features as time goes on.

## Manage your daily tasks

By using the student oriented task form, your tasks can now be sorted by subject & difficulty. The tasks can also be dragged from one list to another & help the user visually organise their tasks.

## Keep track of time while studying

By using the study timer, users can cycle through different work cycles including studying (25min), small break (5min) & longer break (15min). This time seperation technique is called Pomodoro.
